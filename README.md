# Will's Resume

## General Notes:
- These are all suggestions and my own opinions, you should put your resume through a scanner like [Indeed's](https://support.indeed.com/hc/en-us/articles/4418654727565-Instant-Resume-Scan)
  - We had access to VMock at NU, you should ask if there are any resources the career office at Purdue could provide!
- Tip: slightly tweaking the resume to make sure it matches the job listing might improve your chances at getting to first round interviews
  - This seems like a lot of work and I never did it but might be worth a shot
- Visually, layout and density is great for both samples. I think SWE1 might be in a better spot at this time

## SWE1
### Header
- Embedded links are great! But can be confusing if they don't match the plain text
- Tip: you can customize your LinkedIn username to get a [custom link](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a542685/manage-your-public-profile-url?lang=en) such that

### Education
- Instead of present, use Aug. 2022 - May 2024 (projected)â€¨

### Technical Skills
- List in decreasing order of confidence and separate clouds and other tech into another list:
> Languages: Python, C/C++, Java, SQL, JavaScript, HTML/CSS
> Frameworks and Libraries: Vue, Node, Express, Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, Seaborn, OpenCV, scikit-learn, requests, BeautifulSoup
> Tools: GitHub, Git, Azure DevOps, AWS (EC2, RDS, Route53)

### Experience
- Include as many measures as possible and as early in the bullet point as possible
    - Recruiters care more about what you achieved than what you used to do it
    - What you used should already be in the tech skills section
    - Rewording example:
        - _before_: Created CI/CD pipeline scripts in Azure DevOps, enabling seamless code deployment to sandbox and production environments, reducing deployment time from 7 minutes to 1 minute, and eliminating manual deployment errors
        - _after_: Reduced deployment time by 85%, eliminated manual errors, and enabled seamless deployment to sandbox and production environments using CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps
- _personal preference_: Avoid repeated uses of 'Developed' and use more synonyms. Focusing more on impact like above will also help with this

### Projects
- I love the list of tools and techniques used for each project, though it should likely be placed on a separate line than the title to pass automated resume systems

## SWE2
- Descriptions seem a bit too verbose in this one
    - Simplification example:
        - _before_: Authenticated JWTs in Middleware from external API for secure communication using JWKs and cached authentication tokens in local storage, decreasing redundant API authentication calls by 80%
        - _after_: Optimized JWT-authenticated API calls by 80% using JWKs and caching
- Limit bullets per experience/project to 3 max
